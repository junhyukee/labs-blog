## Accomplishments

This week was a lot of getting used to the environment I would be working in for the next few weeks. I have worked with others before, but it was at a much smaller scale, and things were not as professional and it was more of a casual experience. Working in a semi-Agile environment took a bit of getting used to, referring to Trello, having constant meetings, but I think I have gotten the hang of it and have slowly began enjoying having a more organized workspace. I personally did more work on the Front-End side, working closely with other team mates to create React components that we would be using in the future. Although a lot of the data pulled were either placeholders or mock data, laying out the components, I believe, provided a lot of value in terms of thinking of the users and how they would interact with the app. I also struggled to figure out what was wrong with our Django + AWS deployment as well as our Django + React integration, where the React webpack files automatically feed into the Django template, however, the team decided to focus on getting actual work done rather than struggling more with configuration. All in all, I would say this was a good week in terms of getting started, but in the future weeks I would like to see myself and my team members accomplish a lot more given a week's worth of work.
